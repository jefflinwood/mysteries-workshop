For this exercise, you have some of the pieces - but not all.

The challenge here is to build and run a Docker image for a Node.js application.

The Dockerfile is incomplete, and missing lines.

Any missing lines have ??? as placeholders, so you know there were lines there.

The existing lines should work without change, but of course, you can change them if needed.

You will also need to come up with two commands from the command line to build the Docker image, and then to run it while listening to a port.

To test your project, go to http://localhost:3000/, and you should see the *Hello, Docker!* message.
